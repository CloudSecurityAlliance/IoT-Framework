<h1> Using the IoT Security Controls Framework </h1>

Figure 1 below details the flow that users of the CSA IoT Security Controls Framework should follow as they assess and then implement security controls for a unique environment. The letters in this illustration correspond to columns in the Framework (spreadsheet).







Figure 1 - Control Assessment 

Evaluation begins by understanding the system architectures’ security and data impact levels. These are characterized based on standard processes, such as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 “Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems” Once impact-level determinations are made for system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, the Framework can be filtered to show only the controls applicable to those impact levels.
Review each of the resulting controls in Column F and review any additional guidance in Column J. 
Columns O, P, Q, and R include a tool for allocating controls to different architectural components. 
These columns allow users to filter controls based on whether they apply to the device, the network that hosts the device, a gateway, or cloud services. 
Users can also understand how to implement each control using columns L, M, and N. These columns offer control-type recommendations, whether controls should be manual, automated, or a combination of both, and how often controls should be exercised. 
The Framework provides insight into an idealized version of a secure baseline tailored to an IoT system architecture following this initial process. Some components within an IoT architecture may not meet a subset of the controls. In these cases, the security architect must understand the residual risk and identify compensating controls to mitigate that risk. 

Security Control Objectives (Columns A, B, C, D, E, F)

Control Domain (Column A): Organized by logical groupings of the individual security control measures (see table below) and detailed in column F (Control), the name of each corresponding control specification is italicized below the category of “Control Domain.”
 
Control Domain (Column B): Domains are categorized for filtering purposes.
Control Sub-Domain (Column C): Sub-domains provide granularity for filtering purposes.
