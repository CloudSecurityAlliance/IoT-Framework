Define authorized MQTT topics and create/enforce an access control list within the broker to restrict IoT devices from publishing content or subscribing to unauthorized message topics. Encrypt all MQTT messages. Use certificates to authenticate MQTT transactions. Consider throttling traffic to MQTT servers on both a global and per-client basis and always route MQTT traffic through a firewall. Reduce the standard MQTT message size to limit an attackers' ability to overload the system by sending large messages.<br><br> | Medium          | Medium    | Medium       | Many IoT implementations use publish/subscribe protocols such as MQTT. Consider implementing read/write restrictions on sensitive topics used within the system. MQTT by default does not encrypt the password field. SSL certificates can be used by the server for authenticating the clients when TLS is used. Clients can also authenticate using LDAP or OAuth tokens or leverage OS authentication mechanisms. MQTT does not have a mechanism for authenticating the server. However, use of SSL certificates when using TLS or use of a VPN can identify which server the client is trying to connect to. Throttling the server protects against an overload of server processing capacity, which could cause latency or availability issues. Smaller message sizes help prevent DoS attacks. | MQTT Version 3.1.1 Plus Errata 01: OASIS Standard Incorporating Approved Errata 01 - 5.4.1 and 5.4.3<br>http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/errata01/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-errata01-os-complete.html#\_Toc442180929<br><br>MQTT Version 3.1.1 Plus Errata 01: OASIS Standard Incorporating Approved Errata 01 - 5.4.8<br>http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/errata01/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-errata01-os-complete.html#\_Toc442180929                    | P               | A                   | C    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    | TRUE          |

If the network receives anything else, it could consider it as a possible attack. Once the single packet is verified the authentication is completed, and the specific port will be open to the IP address which sent the single packet. This firewall and security policies are then configured and a connection via traditional network protocols is established. After a connection is established, all configuration is removed, and the port/service is hidden from all other devices. | [CSA: SDP Architecture Guide v2<br>https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/sdp-architecture-guide-v2/](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/sdp-architecture-guide-v2/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | P | M | E | TRUE | TRUE | TRUE |      |
