| Identity and Access Management | Password Management             | IAM-21     | IAM                  | If passwords are used for remote access to IoT devices, update said passwords at least once per year. When possible, implement mechanisms that allow for the update of said passwords automatically. Given the amount of IoT devices that populate networks, it is preferable to use certificates for remote access as passwords become difficult to manage as quantities of devices increase. | Medium          | Medium    | Medium       | Given the amount of IoT devices that populate networks, it is preferable to use certificates for remote access as passwords become difficult to manage as quantities of devices increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | NIST Special Publication 800-63B - Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management<br>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | P               | M                   | A    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    | TRUE          |
