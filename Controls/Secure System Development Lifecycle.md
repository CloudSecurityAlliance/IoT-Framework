The security tests are actually happening while the application is being used. So, while the team is unit testing, or QA testing, or UAT testing, the IAST tool is testing in the background as well. It works using by using instrumentation and hooking into applications during runtime.                                                       | OWASP: Source Code Analysis Tools<br>https://owasp.org/www-community/Source\_Code\_Analysis\_Tools<br><br>OWASP: Vulnerability Scanning Tools<br>https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability\_Scanning\_Tools<br><br>OWASP: Free for Open Source Application Security Tools<br>https://owasp.org/www-community/Free\_for\_Open\_Source\_Application\_Security\_Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | C               | S                   | E    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    |               |

There are hundreds of issues that could affect the overall security of a web service or application. Even without changing a single line of your application's code, you may become vulnerable as new flaws are discovered and attack methods are refined. Security vulnerabilities can be quite complex and deeply buried in code. In many cases, the most cost-effective approach for finding and eliminating these weaknesses is human experts armed with advanced tools. Relying on tools alone provides a false sense of security and is not recommended.

Communicate the outputs of your threat model into the system requirements backlog and track these requirements to closure across the lifecycle of the product or system. | Medium          | Medium    | Medium       | There are many threat modeling approaches available. The OCTAVE Allegro approach from Carnegie Mellon provides a framework for threat modeling. Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle can also be adapted to the IoT. Microsoft includes a threat classification aid known as STRIDE that assists analysts in identifying pertinent threats to their systems. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege. Once appropriate threats have been identified per category, the Microsoft DREAD model can then be used to rate the threats. DREAD supports remembrance of the inputs to a risk rating process: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | "Cloud Security Alliance Future Proofing the Connected World<br>https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/assets/research/internet-of-things/future-proofing-the-connected-world.pdf<br><br>Microsoft Threat Modeling<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-accelerators/iot-security-architecture"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | P               | S                   | C    | TRUE   | TRUE    | TRUE    | TRUE          |
