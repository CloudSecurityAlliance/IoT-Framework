While Bluetooth LE beacons bring lots of potential in the IOT design, security threats such as device tracking, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attack are increasing significantly. BLE devices are designed to broadcast MAC, UUID and service information at a predefined interval. Due to continuous advertisement, hackers can easily track the device and decode the broadcasting information using a sniffers or even smartphone. Secure bluetooth implementations on your IoT device with pairing, secure key generation, bonding, encryption static/private device address, authentication over proximity, hidden mac and other techniques. | NIST SP 800-121 r2<br>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-121r2.pdf                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | P               | S                   | E    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    |               |
