IoT devices can quickly become out of date and need regular security patching, software updates, and even firmware updates. This poses challenges in managing the life cycle of large IoT devices. Often software and firmware updates are expected to be a low-cost process and be done remotely via wireless. Unfortunately, the software update over the air (SOTA), and firmware update over the air (FOTA), sometimes pose security challenges such as unauthorized software and firmware, man-in-the-middle-attack, and software corruption during the update process.                                                                                     | Linux Foundation: SOTA Solution FOTA Solution for AGL<br>https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ALS19\_AGL\_RAUC\_AS\_SOTA\_FOTA\_SOLUTION\_v1r01.pdf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | D               | A                   | E    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    |               |
