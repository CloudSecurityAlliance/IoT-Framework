This secure RTOS introduces a number of key security concepts that help the OS protect against malicious attacks, regardless of how they enter the system. A RTOS with enhanced security features is the best protection for the embedded connected device, as it still offers the real-time characteristics, supports the required network functionality, and typically has a smaller footprint than a general purpose OS like Linux. It also offers advanced security protection including discretionary access control for file-system objects,fine-grained user-access control using roles and capabilities, identification and authentication control of users, device and system quotas to help thwart distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, trusted path mechanisms for guaranteed communication links, and residual information protection to stop attacks by reusing or viewing used memory. | Enisa Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT<br>https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot<br><br>The RTOS as the engine powering the IoT:<br>https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/rtos-engine-powering-iot-white-paper.pdf<br><br>Internet of Things (IoT) Operating Systems Management: Opportunities, Challenges, and Solution:<br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332415379\_Internet\_of\_Things\_IoT\_Operating\_Systems\_Management\_Opportunities\_Challenges\_and\_Solution                                                                                                                                                                | P               | M                   | C    | TRUE   |         | TRUE    |               |
