Leverage open-source or commercial static analysis tools that integrate into build pipelines. Automate dynamic analysis testing into pipelines with web scanning tools that enable automation via APIs such as OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). Comparable mobile app and firmware dynamic analysis automation tooling should be used.                                         | OWASP ZAP<br>https://www.zaproxy.org/<br><br>Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)<br>https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF<br><br>Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT)<br>https://fkie-cad.github.io/FACT\_core/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | P               | S                   | M    | TRUE   | TRUE    |         | TRUE          |
| Security Testing | IoT Applications and Services (Internally Developed) | SET-07     | TVM<br>BCR           | Perform security tests on each product and incrementally on system releases. Ensure that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components including container orchestration tooling undergo static analysis testing as part of system deployment pipeline workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Low             | Low       | Low          | Due to the constraint nature of IoT devices, security should be embedded in the design itself to reduce device's susceptibility to external attack. Infrastructure supporting an IoT ecosystem should make use of automated testing as part of deployments or embedded into pipelines using static analysis tooling for infrastructure-as-code. System testing should also include common attack test cases that allow for domain takeovers as a result of DNS misconfigurations or maintenance. | GitHub: Aquasecurity TFSEC<br>https://github.com/liamg/tfsec<br><br>Terraform Parliament - Run Parliament AWS IAM Checker on Terraform Files<br>https://github.com/rdkls/tf-parliament<br><br>Vulnerability Static Analysis for Containers<br>https://github.com/quay/clair<br><br>GitHub: AquaSecurity Kube-Bench<br>https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | P               | S                   | C    | TRUE   | TRUE    | TRUE    | TRUE          |
