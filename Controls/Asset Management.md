|  Asset Management | Inventory Assets  | ASM-01  | DCS  | Schedule a task to update the asset/inventory database at least quarterly.   | Medium  | Medium  | Medium  | Additional information that may be useful to include are the related/associated devices that directly interface with the device. These may include printers, network-attached storage (NAS), mobile applications, USB dongles, and so on. This inventory database should be made available to incident responders as well. The data recorded can prove highly useful during an incident.   | CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/  | P | A   | C  | YES  |   | YES  |   |   |
| Asset Management  | Inventory Assets   | ASM-02 | DCS  | Deploy an inventory management system (asset/inventory database) and record details about each IoT device in inventory.  Use this inventory management system to track the hardware, software/firmware, network configurations and location of each device. This includes device name, the Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) that hosts the device, device physical location, IP address of the device, MAC address, software/firmware version data, vendor details associated Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), communication protocols, whether the device includes cellular capability, firmware and patch status, application/library versions, lost or decommissioned status, whom the device is assigned  | Medium | Medium  | Medium  | Additional information that may be useful to include are the related/associated devices that directly interface with the device.

| Asset Management  | Monitor Assets  | ASM-03  | DCS | Monitor IoT device power levels by configuring devices to alert on low-battery or increased battery drainage. Investigate any discovered incidents associated with excess battery drainage.  | High  | High  | High  | Many devices operate using batteries. There are attacks that target devices with the specific goal of draining the battery. Using protocols such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), as well as other methods, devices can report their health status including battery state to centralized monitoring stations. This may help to combat against attacks aimed at draining the energy from critical routing nodes in WSN architectures. | IT Asset Management https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-5.pdf  | D  | A | C  | YES  |   | YES  |   |   |
| Asset Management  | Naming Convention  | ASM-04  | DCS  | Establish naming conventions for your devices. Configure unique identifiers for each device. Identifiers should be unique across the enterprise and designed to scale as more devices are added to the organization, without introducing naming conflicts. | Low  | Low  | Low  |   | This control can be mapped to NISTIR 8259A which calls for the inclusion of a unique logical identifier on each device, as well as a unique physical identifier at an external or internal location.  Work with your vendors to ensure that each device includes both a logical and a physical identifier. These identifiers may then be used as input into your organizations' unique naming scheme.   | NISTIR 8259A: IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259A.pdf IT Asset Management https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-5.pdf  | P  | A  | E  | YES  |   | YES |   |
